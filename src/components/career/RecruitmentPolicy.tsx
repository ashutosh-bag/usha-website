            Recruitment Policy

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">General Detail</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg ">
           The recruitment and selection process is of paramount importance in order to recruit staff with the necessary skills and attributes to enable the Organization to fulfill its corporate aims and objectives. The Recruitment and Selection Policy and Procedures aim to provide clear guidance to managers in relation to both the selection and appointment of staff. This policy promotes and supports good practice for those with responsibility for recruitment.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-lg">
            The Policy and procedure aims to achieve the following objectives:
            <li>Recruit staff with the appropriate skills, both technical and personal, in order to meet the USHA’s current and future needs.</li>
            <li>To ensure that staff appointed to different positions are qualified to carry out such duties or are working towards an appropriate qualification.</li>
            <li>Work to a fair and effective recruitment procedure, which is consistent with employment legislation and the USHA’s equal opportunities policies and practices.</li>
            <li>Develop and enhance the public image of the Organization, both as an employer and as a quality provider of operation and research.</li>
          </ul>
       
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg">
            Internal candidates or others personally known to the interview panel must be treated in exactly the same way as all other candidates.

This policy and associated procedures applies to all members of staff other than senior post holders as defined in the Articles of Association.

Additional guidance on the procedures to be followed in the recruitment of a typical and casual staff is provided separately.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800  font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Key Considerations</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-lg">
            Before recruitment begins, the following will be given consideration:
            <li>is it necessary to fill the vacancy?</li>
            <li>does the role require changes in duties and responsibilities?</li>
            <li>is it appropriate to evaluate the grade of the post?</li>
            <li>could the work be accommodated in other ways?</li>
            <li>what terms and conditions are being offered for the post? Are they appropriate and consistent with the rest of the Organization?</li>
            <li>are there any staff ‘at risk’? Staff at risk within the organization must be given first consideration for any vacancy prior to an external / internal advertisement being placed.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Filling the Vacancy</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-2">
            In order for the recruitment process to commence, the Director of Organization/ Department must gain authorization, using appropriate documentation. The following documentation must be completed for recruitment to all posts:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-lg">
            <li>Recruitment Request – HR / Finance Authorization Form</li>
            <li>Job Description</li>
            <li>Person Specification</li>
            <li>Occupational Health Evaluation Form</li>
             
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Advertising</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
           It is normal practice that all vacancies are advertised, both internally within the organization, as well as externally. However, where it is considered that existing staff have the prerequisite skills consideration may be given to advertising posts internally only. Staff who have been identified to be ‘at risk’ may be considered for vacant posts prior to internal / external advertisment if they meet all the essential criteria of the vacancy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            There may be exceptional occasions when  USHA deems it appropriate to use “search” techniques. Before doing so, the Director of Organization / Department must secure prior permission from their Executive line manager that “search” is the appropriate method.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Enquiries</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
           All enquirers will receive a recruitment information pack detailing the requirements of the post. Wherever possible, it will be provided in electronic format.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Selection</h3>
          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Short listing</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-2">
            Candidates will only be short listed for interview if they meet all the essential criteria defined in the person specification. If the number of candidates meeting the essential criteria is excessive, further selection must be undertaken utilizing the desirable criteria to achieve a workable shortlist (suggest no more than 6).
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-2">
            Short listing must be undertaken by at least two individuals who are experienced in the recruitment process and who will go on to be involved in the interviewing process.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2"> Interviewing</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            The interview must be conducted by a panel, the suggested composition of which is detailed in the procedures. All interviews for one post must be conducted by the same panel.
          </p>
           <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            All candidates will be asked a standard format of questions, which will have been decided by the interview panel prior to the interviews. All questions must be related to the job requirements and the candidate’s suitability to undertake the role.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2"> Skill Assessment</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-2">
            As part of the selection process, Organization/Departments may wish candidates to partake in a series of skills tests. These tests must be directly related to the role in question and must be measurable against objective criteria. Candidates must be informed of the details in the letter inviting them for interview. Details of any skills tests, including the criteria to be measured and the method of measuring must be provided in advance to HRD.
          </p>
          

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Appointment</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-2">
           The choice of candidate will be determined by the majority view from the formal interview panel. The panel will take account of any other information that will have been generated as part of the selection process. In the case of a tied vote, the Chairs decision will carry.
          </p>
           <p className="text-lg mb-2">
           A formal offer of appointment is to be made / confirmed in writing and will be conditional upon receipt of references which satisfy Organization requirements, medical assessment, satisfactory evidence of eligibility to work in the Country and other appropriate checks, such as Criminal Records, if applicable to the post.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7. Confidentiality</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            All application details are treated with the utmost confidentiality. It is the responsibility of the Director of Organization / Department (or her/his nominee) to ensure that suitable arrangements are made for confidentiality to be maintained.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8. Documentation</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            At all stages of the recruitment process, it is the responsibility of the Chair of the panel to ensure that notes are kept detailing the reasons for selection or rejection of candidates. These notes could be called upon as evidence of the fairness of the process, either through an internal assessment or to support an external investigation. The notes should therefore be relevant to, and necessary for the process itself. It should be noted that applicants would normally be entitled to have access to interview notes about them which are retained as part of the record of the interview. All records must be handed to HRD by the Chair of the panel.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9. Feedback</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
           All applicants may receive formal written communication informing them of the status of their application upon request. Feedback will be provided by the Chair of the panel at the request of any applicant at any stage of the recruitment process.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">10. Observation</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
           In order to ensure the USHA’s compliance with both the Recruitment and Selection and Equal Opportunities Policies and Procedures, an Observer may be present at any part of the process from short listing through to selection. Observation may be undertaken by an appropriate recognized Trade Union representative or member of Human Resources Department. In addition, an equal opportunities observer may also be present. In order for an individual to become an authorized Observer, they must undertake approved training. However, the Observers do not actively participate in any stage of the proceedings and do not have voting rights for selection.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl text-green-800 font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11. Monitoring</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            The Organization will from time to time undertake audit exercises in order to monitor the effectiveness of this policy and its performance against the Equal Opportunities policy.
